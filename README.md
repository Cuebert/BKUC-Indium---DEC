##### Note for Roblox
If you have any issue with the existence of this repository please let me know and I will promptly take it down, the most effective manner of doing so would probably be an email or by opening an issue. It is not necessary to initiate any legal action, my intention is not to expose any Roblox intellectual property or the use of cheats/exploits on your platform. I simply want to provide users with the information necessary to avoid malware and stay safe.

##### Disclaimer
PLEASE NOTE I AM NOT AT ALL AFFILIATED OR PRACTICALLY EVEN IN CONTACT WITH THE DEVELOPERS OF THIS APP
They banned me from their discord server for reasons I am not aware of, possible just because I was decompiling their app and they don't like that which would be a major red flag security wise.
for full transparency, the discord server of the devs is discord.gg/security-research, please do not join the server with the intention of being argumentative, combative, or toxic in any way.

Overall it seems benign

The two detections in virustotal are due to the apk being signed by android studio with test keys rather than proper production keys which isn't a big deal.

if you take a look at the two Quixxi scans in the pdf files INDIUM.pdf and ROBLOX.pdf you can see a comparison between this roblox client and the official roblox client. You will see there are 2 more vulnerabilities present in the Indium one which matches the virustotal scan and is probably due to the same reasons. Although it should be taken into account that Indium is a slightly older package version and roblox may have simply patched 2 vulns in that time.

Looking through the code the worst thing that i found was some analytics stuff which is probably from roblox itself and some support for remote debugging which is kind of questionable but ehh.

debugging/profiling analysis pending.


even if it itself is not malware, using a work.ink download link is distasteful and reflects poorly on the character of the devs.
this is the official download link but i suggest recommend against using it https://workink.me/3s6/boykisseruncentral-roblox
if you are a normal person that doesnt like work.ink i will put the current version in the releases so you can download it from here instead.
